Irish pubs are renowned across the world for their colourful characters and friendly atmosphere. The Irish Village in Dubai is no exception. Since its opening in October 1996, it has always been looked upon as a small piece of Ireland in the heart of Dubai. Designed in the form of a typical Irish village street, its authenticity comes from the use of Irish materials such as Liscannor stone and craftsmanship, all of which have been imported from the Emerald Isle.
